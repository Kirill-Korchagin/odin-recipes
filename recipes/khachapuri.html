      <h3>Description</h3>
      <p>Ajarski khachapuri is a boat-shaped Georgian bread with a cheese-stuffed crust and an egg baked into the center. It's only a matter of time before this fun bread is delivered to every home for pizza night and ordered from every brunch menu the morning after. This versatile bread takes a little finesse, but the payoff is well worth it; after all, what more could you want other than cheesy, soft, chewy bread dipped in runny yolk and molten cheese?</p>
      <h3>Ingredients</h3>
      <h3>Dough</h3>
      <ul>
            <li>½ cup warm milk</li>
            <li>⅓ cup warm water</li>
            <li>More to come...</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Cheese Blend</h3>
      <ul>
            <li>8 ounces feta cheese, crumbled</li>
            <li>4 ounces Monterey Jack cheese, shredded</li>
            <li>4 ounces low-moisture mozzarella cheese, shredded</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Filling</h3>
      <ul>
            <li>2 large eggs</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon butter, cut into 4 pats</li>
            <li>sea salt to taste</li>
            <li>1 pinch cayenne pepper, or to taste (Optional)</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Steps</h3>
      <ol>
            <li>Make dough: Combine milk, water, yeast, and sugar in a large bowl. Let stand until yeast forms a creamy foam, about 5 minutes. Add 2 cups flour, olive oil, and salt; mix until a sticky dough forms.</li>
            <li>Turn dough out onto a floured surface. Knead for about 3 minutes, adding in remaining 1/4 cup flour as needed, until dough is very soft but still workable. Form into a ball and place in a lightly oiled bowl. Cover and let rise in a warm spot until doubled in volume, 1 to 1 1/2 hours.</li>
            <li>Preheat the oven to 475 degrees F (245 degrees C).</li>
            <li>More to come...</li>
      </ol>
