      <h3>Description</h3>
      <p>Roasting chicken and potatoes in the oven is a classic Greek meal. Honey mustard is also used in many Greek recipes. Here, two classics combine for a delicious one-pan dinner. The potatoes are melt-in-your-mouth and the honey mustard sauce that magically develops in the pan is so good you may want to drink it!</p>
